randomQuoteGenerator.js is a Node.js API that extracts a random verse from Liber AL Vel Legis

This project is intended to support "Build a Random Quote Machine" from freeCodeCamp, also because there can be people very interested in this functionality and service.

The JSON file being used is declared within the code, the configured listening port is 8080 and its the first variable declared in the file.

A license for such a simple file doesn't make much sense, but if you wish to contact me please do and use:
