randomQuoteGenerator.js is a Node.js RESTful API that extracts a random verse from Liber AL Vel Legis

This project is intended to support "Build a Random Quote Machine" from freeCodeCamp.

The JSON file being used is declared within the code, the configured listening port is random in Heroku hosting (which required the use of the express library).

A license for such a simple file doesn't make much sense, but if you wish to contact me please do and use:
